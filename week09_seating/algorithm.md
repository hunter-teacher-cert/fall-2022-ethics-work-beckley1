# Description of Plane Seating Algorithm
---

*n.b. This algorithm is being written after many failed attempts to account for problems posed in the original plane_seating.py code*

1. Program will ask for user input to reserve a seat on a 7 X 4 seating grid using a 2d array.

2. Program will check to see if there are seats available.

3. If available, the seat will be reserved.

4. If not available, user will be told the flight is sold out.

5. If desired seat is already taken, user will be prompted to enter a different seat.
