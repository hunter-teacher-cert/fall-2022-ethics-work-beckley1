#  The Airplane Seating program asks the user for the seat they would like to reserve.
#  A layout of the plane is printed and an X is placed in the reserved seat.  The 
#  program finds if the seat is available and if the entry is valid.  An input of 'q'
#  ends the program.

#  After a lot of difficulty we decided to go with an algorithm that went back to the days
#  when reserving a seat on an airplane actually counted for something and overbooked flights
#  didn't exist!

#  Obviously the algorithm we were supposed to produce was beyond our coding prowess. After many
#  attempts we ended up finding a simple plane reservation code in Java and did our best
#  to translate it into Python.

#  The original Java source can be found here by author Quang Pham:

# Things we could NOT account for accessibility wise:
#	* People in need of special seating for physical disabilities
